                        Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. 
                        They are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. 
                        Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, 
                        appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout most of the Northern
                         Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. 
                         Bears are found on the continents of North America, South America, and Eurasia. 
                         Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, 
                         long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with 
                         five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

                        The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. 
                        It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
                        Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, 
                        with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to 
                        eight extant species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, 
                        and individual species can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Seven other 
                        extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

                        The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, 
                        native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; 
                        a short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of 
                        its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than 
                        females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, 
                        forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a 
                        few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions 
                        usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. 
                        The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions 
                        scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, 
                        lions typically do not actively seek out and prey on humans.

                        Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, 
                        also known as the simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians 
                        are counted as monkeys except the apes. Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an 
                        incomplete paraphyletic grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, 
                        apes (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians synonyms in regard to their scope.

                        An alligator, or colloquially gator, is a large reptile in the genus Alligator 
                        of the family Alligatoridae of the order Crocodilia. The two extant species are 
                        the American alligator (A. mississippiensis) and the Chinese alligator (A. sinensis). 
                        Additionally, several extinct species of alligator are known from fossil remains. 
                        Alligators first appeared during the late Eocene epoch about 37 million years ago.
